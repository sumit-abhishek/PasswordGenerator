# Password Generator

The Password Generator project is a small web application built using React to demonstrate the effective use of React hooks, including useState, useEffect, and useCallback. This application allows users to generate random passwords based on selected criteria such as length, inclusion of numbers, and special characters. The use of useState hook manages the state of input fields and settings, useEffect triggers the password generation whenever the input criteria change, and useCallback ensures the password generation logic remains efficient and prevents unnecessary re-renders. The project showcases fundamental React concepts and provides a practical example of creating a dynamic, user-interactive interface.
